# oop_course_habit_tracker

Project scope:

This project was the creation of a habit tracker back end in Python 3.7 or later. The habit class was to be implemented with the object-oriented paradigm in mind.
Requirements included the possibility of creating custom habits with (at least) the daily and weekly frequency, the inclusion of dummy data for 5 predefined habits
(at least 1 daily and 1 weekly), a way to store data in between sessions (here I used sqlite3), the functionality of analyzing habits, a way for the user to interact
with the app, and lastly a unit test suite.

Install and run the program:

In order to run the habit tracker app you will need a program capable of executing .py files. For simplicity I'd recommend downloading the newest version of the python IDE
from python.org, although I personally use visual studio code.
